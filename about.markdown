A little bit about me:

- Currently a PhD student at the University of Utah
- Working with profesor [Rogelio E. Cardona-Rivera](http://rogel.io/)
- Topic of interest: AI in Games

Pet projects:

- [BPP](https://github.com/BlopaSc/BPP): A C++ library integrating various data structures, data serialization, OS calls and other things I might require in other projects.
- [DoradoPlanner](https://github.com/BlopaSc/DoradoPlanner): A general forward planner supporing basic PDDL, I do plan to extend this project further in the future.
- Working in a couple of side projects which include: a Fox in the Forest AI implementation, some procedural art generation (like the one used for my homepage) and some custom made cipher algorithm.
